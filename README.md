# hello / dbank

Contains code for creating the standard `hello` canister, as well as a very simple `dbank` app which allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, with the funds accruing interest over time.

## hello

See `src/hello_backend` and `src/hello_frontend`.
Based on the [official tutorial](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins).
Contains a single canister callable function called `greet`.

On-chain UI: None, replaced with the dbank canister for testing purposes and don't want to re-deploy again as it will waste cycles unnecessary.

## dbank

Very simple bank interface which allows users to deposit and withdraw funds.
The funds accrue interest over time, but the compound is only calculated when the funds are deposited / withdrawn.
The compounding function is a very silly one - 1% every minute. *...sigh...* Only if...

On-chain UI: https://bnzsz-jyaaa-aaaap-qay3a-cai.ic0.app/

## Running the project locally

To test the project locally, use the following commands:

```bash
# Set rust backtrace to get more useful debug info when things go wrong
export RUST_BACKTRACE=full

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys the canisters to the replica and generates the candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, the application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Useful commands

Check on-chain balance: `dfx wallet --network=ic balance`
Get principal ID: `dfx identity get-principal`
Get ledger ID: `dfx ledger account-id`
Get on-chain wallet ID: `dfx identity --network=ic get-wallet`
